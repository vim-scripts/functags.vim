This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=78

This script generates menu entries for each C/C++ function definition within the actual edited C/C++ file.
After executing it, you can move to any of the functions by selecting them via menu.

- adds a menu entry under a main menu 'Proj'
- creates a file cfunctags.vim as script for generating the menu entries

BUGS: does not handle references ('&') and destructors (~) correctly.
           If anyone would add these, please let me know.

The script is just quick and (hope not very) dirty written, but working (only short tests up to now)
under GVIM 5.8, NT4.0, Novell network
